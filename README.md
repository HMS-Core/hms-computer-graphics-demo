## Introduction
    This is the repository of computer graphics kit samples. We have three samples by now:
    1. [cgkit-rendering-demo](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-computer-graphics-demo/tree/master/samples/cgkit-rendering-demo): Load and render a basic model, with PBR and lights.
    2. [smart-cache-gles](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-computer-graphics-demo/tree/master/samples/smart-cache-gles): The sample code describes how to use OpenGL Smart Cache.
    3. [smart-cache-prerotation-vulkan](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-computer-graphics-demo/tree/master/samples/smart-cache-prerotation-vulkan): The sample code describes how to use Vulkan Smart Cache and Pre-rotation.
    For more infomation, you can check out the README file at each sample.

## Introduction

This project contains HUAWEI ML Kit APIs and apps developed based on the HMS Core ML SDK. The project directory is as follows:
1. [MLKit-Sample](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo/blob/master/MLKit-Sample): Provides examples of using basic functions of HUAWEI ML Kit.
2. [ID-Photo-DIY](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo/blob/master/ID-Photo-DIY): Uses the image segmentation function of HUAWEI ML Kit to synthesize static images of people into a certificate photo with a blue or white background.
3. [Photo-Translate](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo/blob/master/Photo-Translate): Uses the text recognition and translation functions of HUAWEI ML Kit to translate text in static photos into the required language.
4. [Smile-Camera](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo/blob/master/Smile-Camera): Uses the face detection function of HUAWEI ML Kit to identify whether a user is smiling and capture the smiling photos of the user.
5. [Homework-Reader](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo/tree/master/Homework-Reader): Uses the text recognition and TTS functions of HUAWEI ML Kit to get the text in photos and convert it into audio output.
6. [ASRSampleKotlin](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo/blob/master/ASRSampleKotlin): Uses the automatic speech recognition function of HUAWEI ML Kit to convert speech into text in real time.
7. [TTSSampleKotlin](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo/blob/master/TTSSampleKotlin): Uses the text to speech function of HUAWEI ML Kit to convert text into speech and allow users to choose the volume and speed.
8. [TranslatorKotlin](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo/tree/master/TranslatorKotlin): Use the automatic speech recognition, text translation, and  text to speech services of HUAWEI ML Kit to translate English speech into Chinese speech. 
## Precautions

The project contains multiple independent projects. After downloading code,
you can open a project in Android Studio to build your app or add multiple apps to a project.
You do not have to create a separate project for each app. You can open setting.gradle to select the project to build.
