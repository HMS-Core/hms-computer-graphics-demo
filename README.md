2. [smart-cache-gles](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-computer-graphics-demo/tree/master/samples/smart-cache-gles): The sample code describes how to use OpenGL Smart Cache.
3. [smart-cache-prerotation-vulkan](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-computer-graphics-demo/tree/master/samples/smart-cache-prerotation-vulkan): The sample code describes how to use Vulkan Smart Cache and Pre-rotation.
